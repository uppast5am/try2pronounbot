# pronoun-bot contributor guidelines

## Introduction

Hello!  Thanks for considering contributing to this simple pronoun management bot.  With your help, we can ensure that server owners have an easy-to-configure and easy-to-use method of self-assigning identification roles to users on a discord server.

By following these condtribution guidelines, you can help ensure that enhancements and fixes to this project and its base code can be implemented in quick, effective, and efficient fashion.

As an open-source endeavor, pronoun-bot depends on its users (which hopefully will include you!) to provide meaningful feedback and ideas to further its development and improve upon the core functionality of the project.  But that's not all; documentation is highly important for any end-user-facing product, and pronoun-bot is no different!  If you can contribute anything, be it a bug report, a feature request, code updates, or a wiki page, feel free to do so!

Keep in mind, though, that the issue tracker is for bug reports and feature requests only.  Support, discussion, and other feedback should instead be directed to the [Lepivulptery Development Discord](https://discord.gg/kEB2XtU), under the #pronoun-support channel.

## Responsibilities

Some ground rules for contributing:

- Ensure that any publically visible code members are documented
- Keep messages localized (e.g. console output / bot replies)
- Create issues for any major enhancements and remain open to community feedback.  It might be a good idea to discuss these on the contributors channel on the Discord as well beforehand.  Just ask a moderator for the @contributors role.
- Test any code you plan to check in beforehand
- Be considerate!  The [Node.js Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is a good reference.  Users and contributors can all have different backgrounds, and it is important to be consciencious of and considerate to those differences.  Failure to comply will result in being immediately barred from contributing / banned from the Discord if applicable.  To report a breach of conduct, DM a moderator on the discord, or send an email to the reports inbox at <reports@centurionfox.net>.

## Getting started

Make sure you read the entire contributor guidelines document before submitting a pull request, issue report, or documentation update!

For code contributions, unless you are contributing a one or two line code fix, consider creating a fork of the repository and creating your pull requests there.

## How to report an issue

### Security issues

If you discover a security issue, **do not create a public issue in the repository**. Instead, send an email to our security inbox at <security@centurionfox.net> and we will coordinate from there.  Security issues include:

- being able to run commands that alter guild-wide settings
- allowing a user to perform actions in a server that they are otherwise barred from via role configuration
- Exposed OAuth tokens or other private information

If a security issue is reported as a general issue, *it will be closed and removed without warning or explanation*.  If you are unsure if an issue qualifies as a security issue, feel free to send an email to the security inbox <security@centurionfox.net> anyways!  It's always best to be safe rather than sorry.

### General issues and feature requests

Issue templates are provided for submitting an issue or feature request!  Please fill these out to the best of your ability.  Make sure you provide any logs, stack traces, screenshots, or any other information you feel might be pertinent.  If a report is vague, or a feature is ill-defined, it will be marked `wontfix` and closed.
